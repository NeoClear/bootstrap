## Setup Order
install base packages -> install dotfiles -> run setups -> install extra packages

## Development plan
The current roadmap prioritizes usability over code quality. According to roadmap, stakeholder should build a running project using shell scripts. If time permits, we could extend the project by switching to robust Rust-based configuration management.
